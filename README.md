# SQL_Project_1__Employee_DB_Analysis
This is the first SQL Project that I pushed on GitHub. It uses the Employee Database which has 6 interconnected tables.
It is a complete end-to-end SQL project built on a relational employee database to perform real-world HR, payroll, and workforce analytics using MySQL.
